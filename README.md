# About These Challenges

This repository is a collection of solutions to weekly coding challenges posed by my mentor, Samuel Holtby. The challenges are designed to help me develop my coding skills and to encourage logical problem solving and solution comparison. Each week, we both solve the challenge and compare our solutions. The challenges are varied and cover a range of programming topics, predominantly solved using javascript.

### Usage
If you are interested in completing these challenges, simply visit the Code-Quest repo and read the README.md file to find

### Reading this repo
Each week's challenge will be located in a subdirectory named after the challenge. Inside each challenge directory, you will find a solution file with the completed functions and a test file, used to check the validity of the solution.
